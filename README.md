IQSAR
=====

IQSAR is a project designed to enable chemoinformaticians to make reproducible QSARs purely in IPython or Python.  It is meant for use with the IPython notebook.  In order to run IQSAR, clone this git, change to the IQSAR directory, and import IQSAR.  IQSAR is an ongoing project and I would appreciate any feedback.
