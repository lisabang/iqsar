IQSAR
=====

IQSAR is a project designed to enable chemoinformaticians to make reproducible QSARs purely in Jupyter or Python.  It is meant for use with the Jupyter notebook and currently only supports Python 2 but is being rewritten to support Python 3.  In order to run IQSAR, clone this git, change to the IQSAR directory, and do: 

```
python setup.py install
```

IQSAR is an ongoing project and I would appreciate any feedback.
